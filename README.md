# Simon Laing

I don't have the time to maintain a blog, in its traditional form. But I can share some of the experiences I've had for the benefit of others.

I'm a developer at heart, that's what I'm good at and what I enjoy. Here you'll find the musings of a developer as they encounter challenges, discover opportunities and tricks. I hope that these articles save others time/anguish in future.

Take a look at the projects I've kicked off on GitHub if you'd like to get a flavour of who I am, what I've done and what I aspire to. I focus on quality, detail and clarity. I have an interest in security, performance and the right way of doing things.

I have a experience in dotnet (framework and more recently core) and java - developing services, console apps, web and windows applications.
