# Simon Laing

I don't have the time to maintain a blog, per se. At the same time, I have lots of knowledge and plenty of experiences that I can share for the benefit of others.

I'm a developer at heart, that's what I'm good at and what I enjoy. Here you'll find the musings of a developer as they encounter challenges, discover opportunities and tricks. I hope that these articles save others time/anguish in future.

Take a look at the projects I've kicked off on GitHub if you'd like to get a flavour of who I am, what I've done and what I aspire to.
